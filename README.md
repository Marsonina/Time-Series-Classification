Time Series Classification: develop a deep learning model that classifies multivariate temporal series.
Dataset Description
## 🏴‍☠️ The Pirate Pain Dataset

Ahoy, matey! This dataset contains multivariate time series data, captured from both ordinary folk and pirates over repeated observations in time. Each sample collects temporal dynamics of body joints and pain perception, with the goal of predicting the subject’s true pain status:

* no_pain
* low_pain
* high_pain


## ⚓ Files

pirate_pain_train.csv — training set
pirate_pain_train_labels.csv — labels for the training set
pirate_pain_test.csv — test set (with no labels)
sample_submission.csv — an example of random submission


## 🧭 Data Overview

Each record represents a time step within a subject’s recording, identified by sample_index and time. The dataset includes several groups of features:

* pain_survey_1–pain_survey_4 — simple rule-based sensor aggregations estimating perceived pain.
* n_legs, n_hands, n_eyes — subject characteristics.
* joint_00–joint_30 — continuous measurements of body joint angles (neck, elbow, knee, etc.) across time.


## 🏴‍☠️ Task

Predict the real pain level of each subject based on their time-series motion data.
